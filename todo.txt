- make more of a component of a text field (which is now used for the addressbar), so we can reuse it

- put the cursor at the correct place in the text when clicking in an already selected textfield (should be easy, we already have the pixel mappings)



features still needed for 0.1 release:
       - load another image format besides PNG
       - test on mac / windows (document SDL install?)
       - add a readme
       - don't crash on non-closed tags (or out of order closed tags)
