goals for 0.5.0:
       - better testing setup
              - implement mocking (with a type alias) of the platform
              - reftests
                     - enable the first one once whitespace issues are fixed
              - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
                     - this works, but we need to make a generic function so we can have a nice way of having many tests
              - we can probably test layout by converting the layout tree to json, and assert specific things (not equals on the whole tree)
       - BUG: when you go to a page with a lot of paragraphs, selection does not work correct, when in between paragraps, paragraphs below get selected
       - I need to think about where I want to introduce the platform. Now its a bit messy, since to measure font size we need the platform, therefore needing it
              in layout. Or do we accept that and just get better at mocking?
                     -> use lazy_static , but figure out mocking for tests
       - fix whitespace
              on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Whitespace:
                     In the case of HTML, whitespace is largely ignored â€” whitespace in between words is treated as a single character,
                     and whitespace at the start and end of elements and outside elements is ignored.
       - config a directory path for the files on the home screen, so that we can configure it to not show all the reftests


other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries
       - implement cookies
       - vertical scroll
