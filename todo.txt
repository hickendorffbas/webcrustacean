- BUG: when you go to a page with a lot of paragraphs, selection does not work correct, when in between paragraps, paragraphs below get selected



goals for 0.2.0:
       - test on mac
       - test on windows (document SDL install)
       - get a proper system for parsing CSS values (for the numeric values)
       - show something when loading a new page, so the user knows we are not hanging
              - we now load images in threads, we might need to move the main page load also to a thread, to animate the UI while we load that
                     - the main loop would not change (keep updating and rendering the current tree's, but keep a bool that we are loading a new page
                                                       and keep checking if it is ready. If it is, do the rest of the current load code)
                                                               -> so split the load code in 2


other things (later versions):
       - move to rust 2021
       - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - integration tests by exporting json for the layout tree, so I can test all the way from HTML to layout
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries


specific goals:
       make https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/ usable:
              - be able to render the page
              - be able to render the result page (via direct link)
              - make text input work
              - make form submission work
