- BUG: according to the spec, the IMG tag has no closing tag (also not self closing). I need to ignore a possible close somewhere, so I don't get
       children under the img node (currently that happens if you do <img src="..." />)


- load more different image formats

- work on better automated testing

- add an adressbar
    - make a textinput
