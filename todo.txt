- add tests for css lexing and parsing (maybe first move them into 1 module?)

- make module setup better (move relevant files in folder as mod.rs, and maybe nest them, like css parsing, lexing and style)

features still needed for 0.1 release:
       - build a cursor in the addressbar
       - load another image format besides PNG
       - test on mac / windows (document SDL install?)
       - add a readme
       - don't crash on non-closed tags (or out of order closed tags)
