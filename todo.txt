goals for 0.6.0:
       - rewrite selection logic, mostly done, but open issues:
              - we need to do something better when starting or ending selection in between paragraphs.
       - make page background colors
       - make font colors work (in combination with selection possibly?)
       - bug: make the post on https://old-search.marginalia.nu/ work (it does not submit the search query)
       - if the url in the addressbar does not have a protocol, replace it with https, if that fails, try http


other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries
       - vertical scroll
       - vertical scroll
