- BUG: when you go to a page with a lot of paragraphs, selection does not work correct, when in between paragraps, paragraphs below get selected
- BUG: select_on_first_click does not seem to work in the addressbar (bug is in the click() method checking for focus)

- I need to think about where I want to introduce the platform. Now its a bit messy, since to measure font size we need the platform, therefore needing it
       in layout. Or do we accept that and just get better at mocking?
              -> use lazy_static , but figure out mocking for tests


goals for 0.4.0:
       - basic html form support
              - add the ability to do a POST on formsubmit
                     - we should be able to bind a trigger to a button (or a dom node, rather. in this case click())
                            store those triggers somewhere, and have an enum with actions that we can use there, in this case form submit?
                            then we also need information about the other fields in the form. Those values are in the dom, so this should be a DOM
                            operation in any case, traversing the tree below the form. So on submit, we go up until the form, and then DFS to all inputs
                                   - first goal: add a click() method to the dom, and look up a form if it is a submit input
                                          - first move <a> clicks to there...
                                          - so click() on dom should possibly return a NavigationAction
                                          - the click() on a button component should be implemented, but not currently do anything (later it could animate the click)
                     - we also need a way to communicate the navigation out of that method (we don't want to navigate deep in dom code)
       - better testing setup
              - some way to test with actual webpage examples in files
              - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
                     - this works, but we need to make a generic function so we can have a nice way of having many tests
       - BUG: back button seems to not always work?


other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries


specific goals:
       make https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/ usable:
              - be able to render the page
              - be able to render the result page (via direct link)
              - make text input work
              - make form submission work
