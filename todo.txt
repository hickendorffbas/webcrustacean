- setup a better place to draw things (like just above platform, but below renderer)

    - Then I need a ui.rs that will know about scrollbars, addresbar, popups, etc
    - I will render the webpage just from main, but it knows how much space it can't use due to header and scollbar etc.

    TODO:
        - seperate header drawing from webpage drawing (put header in ui.rs)
        - make space for a scrollbar, and render one without scrolling
        - make the webcontent renderable from a certain x position
        - make the scrollwheel change the rendering position
        - implement the scrolbar controlling that position
