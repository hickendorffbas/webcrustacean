- BUG: when you go to a page with a lot of paragraphs, selection does not work correct, when in between paragraps, paragraphs below get selected
- BUG: back button seems to not always work?
- BUG: we need to set a minimum size for the scrollblock. it gets too small on large pages



goals for 0.3.0:
       - better testing setup
              - some way to test with actual webpage examples in files
              - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
                     - this works, but we need to make a generic function so we can have a nice way of having many tests
	- allow selection in the url bar, and select on first click
       - we need to get the most basic version of callstack and event loop of javascript running, so errors can do the right thing
              - I probably need to give the interpreter the script to execute, so it can decide wheter to call new functions
                or go up in the stack because of an error etc.
                     - so the control of running _functions_ at least need to be at the interpreter level, the rest migth still call each other
                     - the functions (and all below), probably still need a way to exit if an error occurs, because we should continue processing
                     - this means the running a function should return some object that tells it to go into another function?
              - so when calling a function, we need to go through a function in the js-context, that sets up the stack frame etc.
                     - this is easy, but how to handle errors in this case (i.e. how _not_ to continue executing)
                            - maybe we _do_ need result<> for basically every execute function, with the error info there instead of in the execution context
                     - we still might need to unwind the stack, which needs to happen in the execution context, can we?
                            - maybe from a function called from the returning point in the execute()-ing chain when an error is returned?
       - in what context we need to look up values and variables depends on whether they were declared with "var"
              - I don't think we parse that correctly in the AST yet



other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries


specific goals:
       make https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/ usable:
              - be able to render the page
              - be able to render the result page (via direct link)
              - make text input work
              - make form submission work
