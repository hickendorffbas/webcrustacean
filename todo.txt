goals for 0.8.0
       - javascript ternary operator ( ? as an operator in the pratt parser, and then parse logic that reads until its finds the : )
       - load javascript and css files linked from a page
              - add new job system to not block main thread on this
              - css is still todo here
       - scrolling
              - we cull to soon now (check with long page of text paragraphs)
       - handle redirects better. Its seems reqwest follows them, but our url bar does not update etc. we want to follow them ourselves
       - implement more box layout css options
       - add ASI to the js parser



other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries
