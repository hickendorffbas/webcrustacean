features still needed for 0.1 release:
       - come up with a slightly less stupid name
       - test on mac / windows (document SDL install?)
       - very basic history (not viewable), and integrate with back and forward buttons
       - don't crash or hang on complex webpages (its fine if they don't render correctly)


other things (later versions?):
       - move to rust 2021
       - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)


there is still some thinking to do on the layout tree. its now immutable, and created from scratch each frame. That does make sharing refs to
(for example) images in the DOM easier (because we can't have those around when the DOM changes). So we want to push as much computation to the DOM
side as possible, but styles are still resolved after the DOM. We might need to keep a copy of the active styles on the DOM or something.
       -> that _might_ actually be a good idea, think more about it.... we could also cache other things on the DOM!
