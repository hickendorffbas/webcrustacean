- convert the "a" (and headings etc.) tag styling to a default style rule

- do a basic fix for specificity ordering in style rules (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_specificity.asp)

- work on better automated testing



features still needed for 0.1 release:
       - build a cursor in the addressbar
       - load another image format besides PNG
       - test on mac / windows (document SDL install?)
       - add a readme
       - don't crash on non-closed tags (or out of order closed tags)
