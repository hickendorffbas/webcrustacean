- design problem: how are we going to update the DOM from multiple threads? (for example JS modifying DOM)?



goals for 0.2.0:
       - test on mac
       - test on windows (document SDL install)
       - get a proper system for parsing CSS values (for the numeric values)
       - make repeating keys in the url bar work
       - show something when loading a new page, so the user knows we are not hanging
              - we now load images in threads
                     - we still need to trigger the right updates to layout
                            - set the dirty flag on the DOM node, then walk the layout tree
                                   - (we need a seperate pass before to modify the layouttree structure if needed, for now out of scope)
                            - note: dirty nodes also needs a content sync from DOM



other things (later versions):
       - move to rust 2021
       - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - integration tests by exporting json for the layout tree, so I can test all the way from HTML to layout
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries


specific goals:
       make https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/ usable:
              - be able to render the page
              - be able to render the result page (via direct link)
              - make text input work
              - make form submission work
