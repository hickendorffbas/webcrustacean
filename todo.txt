- BUG: if you drag the scrollbar, speed correponds to page moving instead of scrollblock moving


- work on better automated testing

- add an adressbar
    - handle Enter
    - make shift work for special symbols
    - actually load the url you give it
    - make it focus and un-focus on click

- load more different image formats


features still needed for 0.1 release:
       - basic adressbar
       - basic background colors
       - load another image format besides PNG
       - test on mac / windows (document SDL install?)
       - add a readme
