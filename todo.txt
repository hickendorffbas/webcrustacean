features still needed for 0.1 release:
       - load another image format besides PNG
       - test on mac / windows (document SDL install?)
       - add a readme
       - very basic history (not viewable), and integrate with back and forward buttons
       - don't crash or hang on complex webpages (its fine if they don't render correctly)
       - make parse tests nicer by comparing json


other things:
       - move to rust 2021
