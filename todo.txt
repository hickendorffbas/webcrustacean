goals for 0.2.0:
       - test on mac
       - test on windows (document SDL install)
       - get a proper system for parsing CSS values (are they always numbers?)
       - make selecting text work (start with a naive implementation storing all text coordinates)
       - make pasting an url in the url bar work
       - add something about scope to readme (it not being a chrome wrapper, but using SDL / reqwest)
       - show something when loading a new page, so the user knows we are not hanging

other things (later versions):
       - move to rust 2021
       - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - integration tests by exporting json for the layout tree, so I can test all the way from HTML to layout
       - look into threads for UI, network etc. (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-01-threads.html)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries


specific goals:
       make https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/ usable:
              - be able to render the page
              - be able to render the result page (via direct link)
              - make text input work
              - make form submission work
