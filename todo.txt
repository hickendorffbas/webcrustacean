- BUG: when you go to a page with a lot of paragraphs, selection does not work correct, when in between paragraps, paragraphs below get selected
- BUG: back button seems to not always work?


goals for 0.2.0:
       - test on mac
       - test on windows (document SDL install)
       - get a proper system for parsing CSS values (for the numeric values)
		- Have (nicer) methods to extract a number when expected for example, or a value from a set of fixed values


goals for 0.3.0:
       - better testing setup
              - some way to test layout
              - some way to test with actual webpage examples in files
              - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
       - move to rust 2021



other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - integration tests by exporting json for the layout tree, so I can test all the way from HTML to layout
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries


specific goals:
       make https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/ usable:
              - be able to render the page
              - be able to render the result page (via direct link)
              - make text input work
              - make form submission work
