- build something with a timer, so I can do basic animations (for now the blinking cursor)


features still needed for 0.1 release:
       - build a cursor in the addressbar
       - load another image format besides PNG
       - test on mac / windows (document SDL install?)
       - add a readme
       - don't crash on non-closed tags (or out of order closed tags)
