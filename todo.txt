- BUG: if you drag the scrollbar, speed correponds to page moving instead of scrollblock moving


- work on better automated testing




features still needed for 0.1 release:
       - basic background colors
       - build a cursor in the addressbar
       - load another image format besides PNG
       - test on mac / windows (document SDL install?)
       - add a readme
