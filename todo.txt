- work on better automated testing


- need to setup a good structure for storing styles (CSSOM), and figure out where to keep that state




features still needed for 0.1 release:
       - basic background colors
       - build a cursor in the addressbar
       - load another image format besides PNG
       - test on mac / windows (document SDL install?)
       - add a readme
