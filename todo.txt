goals for 0.5.0:
       - better testing setup
              - implement mocking (with a type alias) of the platform
              - some way to test with actual webpage examples in files
              - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
                     - this works, but we need to make a generic function so we can have a nice way of having many tests
       - BUG: when you go to a page with a lot of paragraphs, selection does not work correct, when in between paragraps, paragraphs below get selected
       - I need to think about where I want to introduce the platform. Now its a bit messy, since to measure font size we need the platform, therefore needing it
              in layout. Or do we accept that and just get better at mocking?
                     -> use lazy_static , but figure out mocking for tests
       - implement basic html tables
              - compute proper width for tables


other things (later versions):
       - for layout, in inline context we might need to implement line-boxes
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries
