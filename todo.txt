- BUG: when you go to a page with a lot of paragraphs, selection does not work correct, when in between paragraps, paragraphs below get selected




-> the problem we are having now is that an image is loading in later. We first just make a box node, but we never update the content type of layout nodes
   later. Should we? Otherwise we might need to rebuild the node. We have a dirty flag on the dom node, but its currently only for layout updates

       so the cycle should be:
              - update() all the DOM nodes
              - walk the nodes from root to leafs, rebuild whenever you see a dirty DOM node
              - recompute things like selection order etc.
              - do a re-layout, layout everything, but (as we already do), don't update block layout children if we don't have to


       changes we need to do:
              DONE - ensure the DOM update() is called every frame
              DONE - if there are dirty nodes, walk the _layout_ tree, and find nodes that need rebuild because their DOM equivalent is dirty
              - build new layout node trees for all those nodes
              - insert the new layout nodes in the tree
              - remove all content syncing from the layout pass
              - relayout the whole thing (depending on dirtyness)
              - make sure the dirty flag is only reset after all rebuild and relayout is done, and nowhere in between


goals for 0.4.0:
       - basic html form support
              - add basic button component
                     - I already have the point to render the button, but it should probably a ui component, registered in some dynamic way...
       - better testing setup
              - some way to test with actual webpage examples in files
              - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
                     - this works, but we need to make a generic function so we can have a nice way of having many tests
       - BUG: back button seems to not always work?


other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries


specific goals:
       make https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/ usable:
              - be able to render the page
              - be able to render the result page (via direct link)
              - make text input work
              - make form submission work
