goals for 0.6.0:
       - rewrite selection logic, mostly done, but open issues:
                     - for selection of pictures, if it is the last item we need to start seeing it as selected if we are a bit further from the top
                     - we need to do something better when starting or ending selection in between paragraphs.

       - make page background colors work
       - bug: make the post on https://old-search.marginalia.nu/ work (it does not submit the search query)


other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries
       - vertical scroll
