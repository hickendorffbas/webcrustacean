goals for 0.5.0:
       - better testing setup
              - implement mocking (with a type alias) of the platform
              - some way to test with actual webpage examples in files
              - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
                     - this works, but we need to make a generic function so we can have a nice way of having many tests
       - BUG: when you go to a page with a lot of paragraphs, selection does not work correct, when in between paragraps, paragraphs below get selected
       - I need to think about where I want to introduce the platform. Now its a bit messy, since to measure font size we need the platform, therefore needing it
              in layout. Or do we accept that and just get better at mocking?
                     -> use lazy_static , but figure out mocking for tests
       - implement basic html tables
              - compute proper width for tables
                     - we need to be able to get the size of a text element, also when it is not in a container
                            - so a bit of the inline logic should be moved to the logic positioning a piece of text (it should probably exist in both locations
                              because when inline with other elements we cannot wrap the text by itself, but if the text element is the only node we are formatting
                              we need to do that)
                            - this might also mean we can remove some hack to start inline formatting on a single text node's parent when it is not inline

other things (later versions):
       - for layout, in inline context we might need to implement line-boxes
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries
