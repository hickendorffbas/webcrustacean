- BUG: if you have a page with a lot of <br />, you can't scroll all the way to the bottom
       - it also seems you can scroll when the page is short and the scrollbar does not look like its scrollable


features still needed for 0.1 release:
       - load another image format besides PNG
       - test on mac / windows (document SDL install?)
       - add a readme
       - don't crash on non-closed tags (or out of order closed tags)
       - don't crash on invalid url's
       - add back button (and very basic history, not viewable)
