goals for 0.5.0:
       - better testing setup
              - implement mocking (with a type alias) of the platform
              - make parse tests nicer
                     - compare json instead of objects?
                     - for the html parser, combine lexing and parsing in 1 test?
                            - keep the test for the lexer, because current setup also tests things like token positions
                            - move the other tests to the new json compare, and parsing from html instead of tokens
              - we can probably test layout by converting the layout tree to json, and assert specific things (not equals on the whole tree)
       - I need to think about where I want to introduce the platform. Now its a bit messy, since to measure font size we need the platform, therefore needing it
              in layout. Or do we accept that and just get better at mocking?
                     -> use lazy_static , but figure out mocking for tests


goals for 0.6.0:
       - rewrite selection logic
              - BUG: when you go to a page with a lot of paragraphs, selection does not work correct, when in between paragraps, paragraphs below get selected



other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries
       - implement cookies
       - vertical scroll
