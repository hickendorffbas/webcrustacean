- we should probably load resources (images) when building the DOM tree, not while building the layout tree


features still needed for 0.1 release:
       - load another image format besides PNG
       - test on mac / windows (document SDL install?)
       - add a readme
       - don't crash on invalid url's
       - add back button (and very basic history, not viewable)
