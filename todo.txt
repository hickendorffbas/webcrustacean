goals for 0.2.0:
       - test on linux / mac / windows (document SDL install on each)


other things (later versions):
       - move to rust 2021
       - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - integration tests by exporting json for the layout tree, so I can test all the way from HTML to layout
       - look into threads for UI, network etc. (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-01-threads.html)


there is still some thinking to do on the layout tree. its now immutable, and created from scratch each frame. That does make sharing refs to
(for example) images in the DOM easier (because we can't have those around when the DOM changes). So we want to push as much computation to the DOM
side as possible, but styles are still resolved after the DOM. We might need to keep a copy of the active styles on the DOM or something.
       -> that _might_ actually be a good idea, think more about it.... we could also cache other things on the DOM!
