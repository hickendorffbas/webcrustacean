- BUG: when you go to a page with a lot of paragraphs, selection does not work correct, when in between paragraps, paragraphs below get selected
- BUG: select_on_first_click does not seem to work in the addressbar (bug is in the click() method checking for focus)

- I need to think about where I want to introduce the platform. Now its a bit messy, since to measure font size we need the platform, therefore needing it
       in layout. Or do we accept that and just get better at mocking?
              -> use lazy_static , but figure out mocking for tests


goals for 0.4.0:
       - basic html form support
              - add the ability to do a POST on formsubmit
                     - we should be able to bind a trigger to a button (or a dom node, rather. in this case click())
                            operation in any case, traversing the tree below the form. So on submit, we go up until the form, and then DFS to all inputs
                                   - click() on the DOM still needs to collect the form fields
                     - add post to network module
       - better testing setup
              - implement mocking (with a type alias) of the platform
              - some way to test with actual webpage examples in files
              - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
                     - this works, but we need to make a generic function so we can have a nice way of having many tests
       - BUG: back button seems to not always work?


other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries


specific goals:
       make https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/ usable:
              - be able to render the page
              - be able to render the result page (via direct link)
              - make text input work
              - make form submission work
