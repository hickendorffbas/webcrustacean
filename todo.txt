goals for 0.7.0
       - implement basic flex layout

       - load javascript and css files linked from a page
       - implement more box layout css options
       - add ASI to the js parser
       - scrolling
              - we cull to soon now (check with long page of text paragraphs)
       - fix failing test TODO in style/test_parser::test_multiple_selectors


other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries
