- BUG: when you go to a page with a lot of paragraphs, selection does not work correct, when in between paragraps, paragraphs below get selected
- BUG: select_on_first_click does not seem to work in the addressbar (probably broke when starting to use the constructor)

- I need to think about where I want to introduce the platform. Now its a bit messy, since to measure font size we need the platform, therefore needing it
       in layout. Or do we accept that and just get better at mocking?
              -> use lazy_static , but figure out mocking for tests


goals for 0.4.0:
       - basic html form support
              - add input elements
                     DONE - wrap the components in an Rc<RefCell>
                     DONE - register them in some list for the page (seperate from UI for now)
                     - in the click handler in main, check this list as well, and fire click() if positions match
                     - set focus in the correct cases, and update the focus enum I have somewhere (in ui-state I think?)
                     - handle keypresses (redirect them to the correct component)
                     - make sure we clean the page_components in the right cases (basically rebuild it every frame if the dom changed?)
              - add the ability to do a POST on formsubmit
       - better testing setup
              - some way to test with actual webpage examples in files
              - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
                     - this works, but we need to make a generic function so we can have a nice way of having many tests
       - BUG: back button seems to not always work?


other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries


specific goals:
       make https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/ usable:
              - be able to render the page
              - be able to render the result page (via direct link)
              - make text input work
              - make form submission work
