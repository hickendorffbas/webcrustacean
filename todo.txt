- BUG: images don't seem to be actually inlined yet... (i.e. when you put text before and/or after them)

- BUG: scrolling does weird things if there is nothing to scroll (page is short)

- BUG: according to the spec, the IMG tag has no closing tag (also not self closing). I need to ignore a possible close somewhere, so I don't get
       children under the img node (currently that happens if you do <img src="..." />)


- load more different image formats

- work on better automated testing

- add an adressbar
    - make a textinput
