goals for 0.7.0
       - implement basic flex layout
              - test more basic cases
              - clean up the way we get css values (especially things like the shorthand properties)
                     - I think ideally we convert shorthand to explicit on load, and then only use the explicit ones
       - handle redirects better. Its seems reqwest follows them, but our url bar does not update etc. we want to follow them ourselves
       - load javascript and css files linked from a page
       - implement more box layout css options
       - add ASI to the js parser
       - vertical scroll



other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries
