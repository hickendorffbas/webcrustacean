-> add some performance metrics (enabled optionally) for parts of the render loop
       -> like event polling / rendering / building layout etc.


features still needed for 0.1 release:
       - load another image format besides PNG
       - test on mac / windows (document SDL install?)
       - add a readme
       - very basic history (not viewable), and integrate with back and forward buttons
       - don't crash or hang on complex webpages (its fine if they don't render correctly)
       - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
