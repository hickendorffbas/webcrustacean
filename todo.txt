goals for 0.7.0
       - implement basic flex layout
              - test more basic cases
       - load javascript and css files linked from a page
              - css is still todo here
       - scrolling
              - we cull to soon now (check with long page of text paragraphs)


goals for 0.8.0
       - handle redirects better. Its seems reqwest follows them, but our url bar does not update etc. we want to follow them ourselves
       - implement more box layout css options
       - add ASI to the js parser





other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
