- align where (in which layers) we use ints vs floats (I think as much floats as possible)
    - in general I need to be more specific about what units are used where


- load basic images
    - factor out url loading (i.e. either loading from network or file based on url), put it in network module
        - make a resource loader (that does either file or network)
    - load more different image formats


- work on better automated testing
