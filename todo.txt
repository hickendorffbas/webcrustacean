- BUG: when you go to a page with a lot of paragraphs, selection does not work correct, when in between paragraps, paragraphs below get selected
- BUG: back button seems to not always work?
- BUG: we need to set a minimum size for the scrollblock. it gets too small on large pages


goals for 0.3.0:
       - better testing setup
              - some way to test with actual webpage examples in files
              - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
                     - this works, but we need to make a generic function so we can have a nice way of having many tests
	- allow selection in the url bar, and select on first click
              - works, but we need to make selecting mutually exclusive with other components (such as the main content)
              - BUG: sometimes we the selection jumps all the way to x = 0


other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries


specific goals:
       make https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/ usable:
              - be able to render the page
              - be able to render the result page (via direct link)
              - make text input work
              - make form submission work
