- BUG: when you go to a page with a lot of paragraphs, selection does not work correct, when in between paragraps, paragraphs below get selected


goals for 0.4.0:
       - basic html form support
              - add basic button component
                     - how am I going to give the form items a size? The rects on the layout node are just for text atm. Not sure if I want all different
                       rects for other things. Maybe a generic non-text rect?
                            -> use an enum for layout nodes for different variants
       - better testing setup
              - some way to test with actual webpage examples in files
              - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
                     - this works, but we need to make a generic function so we can have a nice way of having many tests
       - BUG: back button seems to not always work?


other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries


specific goals:
       make https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/ usable:
              - be able to render the page
              - be able to render the result page (via direct link)
              - make text input work
              - make form submission work
