goals for 0.6.0:
       - rewrite selection logic, mostly done, but open issues:
              - we need to do something better when starting or ending selection in between paragraphs.
       - bug: make the post on https://old-search.marginalia.nu/ work (it does not submit the search query)
       - if the url in the addressbar does not have a protocol, replace it with https, if that fails, try http
       - make the javascript parser an RD parser so we can have better errors, and insert semicolons later
              - add indexing[]
              - add ASI
       - bug: the home page links (on about:home) sometimes disappear, but not always


goals for 0.7.0
       - handle redirects better. Its seems reqwest follows them, but our url bar does not update etc. we want to follow them ourselves




other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries
       - vertical scroll
