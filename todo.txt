- BUG: when you go to a page with a lot of paragraphs, selection does not work correct, when in between paragraps, paragraphs below get selected
- BUG: back button seems to not always work?
- BUG: we need to set a minimum size for the scrollblock. it gets too small on large pages



goals for 0.3.0:
       - better testing setup
              - some way to test layout
              - some way to test with actual webpage examples in files
              - make parse tests nicer by comparing json
                     - integration tests by exporting json for the layout tree, so I can test all the way from HTML to layout
       - extremely minimal start of javascript implementation
       - allow selection in the url bar, and select on first click


other things (later versions):
       - fix transparancy in png's (loading works, rendering in SDL does not)
       - figure out how do build standalone binaries


specific goals:
       make https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/ usable:
              - be able to render the page
              - be able to render the result page (via direct link)
              - make text input work
              - make form submission work
